# Nonparametric Statistics
In this workbook I experiment nonparametric statistics estimation with histogram and kernel density function (KDE), and visualize bias-variance trade-off.

- Task 1:  Estimate PDF of X (in an arbitrary point x0) using histogram.

- Task 2: Estimate PDF of X (in an arbitrary point x0) using KDE.

Comment: KDE performs better in comparison to histogram in this case with quick convergence to 0 of bias and much smaller variance

- Task 3: Estimate PDF of a model using local linear regression
